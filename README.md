## Further Roadmap

- proper pagination
- AI integration (those leads who have webiste, collect their email and phone number)
- start integrated marketing campaign from dashboard itelf - SMS, Email & WhatsApp
- AI growth scrore - collect data across all profiles  - GMB, Website & Socail Media - give a scoring to each and suggest the most probable service a business would need, like if a business has 50 followers, it will score a lower point and AI would suggest the plugin user to pitch a Social Media Growth Marketing Business to the GMB owner, similarly a business lacking website would be suggested to offer a website design sevices & those with few GMB Reviews would be suggest a Reputation Management Services.
